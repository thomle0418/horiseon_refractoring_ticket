# horiseon_refractoring_ticket

For this assignment I refractored the HTML and CSS files for Horiseon Social Solutions Services, Inc. Refactoring was done in a manner that retained the integrity of the website. I edited proper semantic elements to the HTML code and increased the web page's acessibility by including detailed descriptions to images. Lastly I condensed CSS attributes that shared similar properties to streamline the file for ease of readability.
